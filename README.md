# 32bit Legacy to ABC Convertor

This is a 32bit version of the original Clarion Template Chain to ABC Convertor.
The code, although in a public repository has no license at the moment whilst I await Robert Zaunere at Softvelocity to confirm what license he would like to put this under.

Original code is (c) Topspeed and so can be assumed (c) Softvelocity until it has a license.

Permission was granted to open source the project during the Clarion Live webinar 681. [Link via YouTube ](https://youtu.be/5OmUAUcJSrw?t=4516)


Modifications to make this code 32bit were made by Russel Eggen.

This repository is dedicated to his memory. I'm sure many of us miss Russ.
